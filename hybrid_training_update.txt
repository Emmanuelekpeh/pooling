# Hybrid Dataset Training Configuration
# Update train_integrated_fast.py with:

DATA_DIR = "./data/ukiyo-e-hybrid"
# Total images: 40
# Traditional: 28 (70.0%)
# Pixel art: 12 (30.0%)

# Expected benefits:
# - Stable NCA growth from pixel art component
# - Rich traditional art learning from ukiyo-e component
# - Best of both worlds approach
